# Lua_MQTT_ESP8266

This arduino SDK helps you easily connect to Dialog IoT platform using the well knows ESP8266 wifi module. MQTT protocol is used and both Events and actions can be triggered from end to end.

For exapmple you can send an on/off command(Actions) to an LED/Relay which is connected to an ESP8266 module through your Dilog IoT developer account or the mobile app which you have built using the Dialog IoT platform API's

And also you can send Event parameters such as sensor values from the sensors connected to ESP8266 module to the Dialog IoT platform or your mobile app.
